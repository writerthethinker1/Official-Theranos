## Official Theranos Website!!!

This is the official Theranos website! It has just about everything the company needs to function well. We will be using the deep web as a main method of communication and transaction. This is a *deep web company* so there arenʻt any central authorities mandating things like...

1. copyrights
2. privacy policies
3. government regulations
4. code of conduct
5. etc...

We still have a *mission statement* which basically outlines the *code of conduct* and the other stuff we wrote above in a ONE PAGE SUMMARY.

Thanks for supporting the *deep web* and all that it can do for you!

Seriously! You guys at Tor made this happen! Congrats!!! Cheers!!!
