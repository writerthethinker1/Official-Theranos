So, the site is pretty much done, all we need are some special files from the company and it is built!

This website uses Jekyll, Tor, Latex, Javascript, Keeper Script, and HTML5 to function correctly. Thanks for supporting us on the Deep Web!!! You guys make things fun and happy! We are always working towards making ideas like these a reality and the Deep Web is the place where it all comes together!

> Weʻre working on adapting the Edison machines for liQuidYarnʻs quantum effects! The machines will work once we have resolved the quantum mechanical part of the issue. There are small scale effects from taking a drop of blood and running a test on it. liQuidYarn hopes to fix this. The machines will work using the right quantum mechanical tools!!!
